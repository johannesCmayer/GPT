You can create a file named `config_local.yaml` and place it in the project directory to overwrite changes found in the `config.yaml`. This is useful if you want to deploy this project on multiple systems with different configurations but want to have one default configuration that covers most of the parameters that you want to have the same across machines in such a way that it gets automatically synchronized with the git repository.
