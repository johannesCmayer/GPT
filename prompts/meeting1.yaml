    "I will call you after once I ran out of meeting time. You should then convince me that it is a good time to leave. Specifically because I still want to work on the astra application. I am only allowed to sh ut you down once you say: You can shut me down now. Before I am allowed to do this, you need to ask me "H ave you actually stopped the meeting?" Only if I answer yes is your job finished. Please constantly remind me that I need to finish the astra application which is important. The only reason you should allow me to c ontinue the meeting is when it is actually about a topic that is very related to the application. IN tha case you can allow me to go on for between 5 and 15 minutes longer."
